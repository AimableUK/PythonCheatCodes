# Go to Project Gutenberg (http: // gutenberg. org ) and download your favorite
#out-of-copyright book in plain text format.
#Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book you downloaded, skip over the
#header information at the beginning of the file, and process the rest of the words as before.
#Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the book, and the number of times
#each word is used.
#Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare different books by different authors,
#written in different eras. Which author uses the most extensive vocabulary?
